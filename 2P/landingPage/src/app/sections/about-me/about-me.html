      <h1>Mini Bio</h1>
      <p>I became interested in technology and software around the age of 17, fascinated by how websites and mobile apps worked. Since then, I've explored front-end and back-end development, always seeking to make digital experiences more human and intuitive.
        <br />
        I have lived in several cities such as Cuenca, Ambato, and Loja due to my father's work.
        <br />
        I graduated from San Jose "La Salle" High School.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading romance, fantasy and classic books. I also love listening to music and exploring places that teach me about the past and help me appreciate the present.
        <br />
        I'm a big fan of hiking and camping, and I'm always looking for new adventures to start</p>
